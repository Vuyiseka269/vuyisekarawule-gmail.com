        <h4>Academics</h4>
        <p>Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School is a Mathematics and Science Focus School. This means that our schools main<br> 
           focus is on attaining and striving for excellence in Pure Mathematics and Physical Science. However, the school<br>
           also offers learners the choice of doing other main stream subjects (FET), as well as Arts related subjects<br><br>

            It is hard to believe that the First quarter of 2019 is nearly at an end! Learners should be preparing for<br> 
            the upcoming Control Test assessments. These test in conjunction with other school based assessment tasks<br> 
            form the mark for the first quarter. It is a good precursor of what can be expected in the June report.<br>
