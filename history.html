        <h4>A brief history of Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School</h4>
            <p>On 31 March 1978, Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School was birthed out of an amalgamation of Matatiele Boys High (founded in 1895), and Matatiele Girls High 
            (founded in 1903). 
            The school, situated in Little Mount Fletcher, stands in its beautiful setting , and in close proximity of rail and road commuter networks, which links the school with the greater Mount Fletcher area.<br><br>
            
            When, in 1991, learner totals at Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School dwindled alarmingly, the school took to heart its motto to ‘Persevere’, and courageously 
            triumphed through trying times. The doors of learning were then opened to learners from far reaching areas across Matatiele. Taking 
            cognisance of the role of a School in a democratic South Africa, the school has become a microcosm of this, enrolling learners from previously 
            disadvantaged areas and communities. Today, our school has a roll of 960 learners  and is still growing.<br><br>
            
            To this end, the school building has in recent years, with ECED funding, been extended to accommodate the growing learner totals. In addition, 
            the school has been included as a Dinaledi, Maths and Science Focus School. This has meant that extra emphasis has been placed on the challenges 
            faced in teaching and learning in the areas of Mathematics, Physical Science and Life Sciences. The school has been fortunate to be part of projects 
            such as MSEP (Maths and Science Education Project), which is bolstered by the University of Cape Town. Other projects involved in the life of Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School
            include the PREPARE project, which is focused on in the compulsory Life Orientation subject area. Here, learners are equipped to face 
            the challenges of growing up in our modern life style, in order for them to become skilled, responsible adults who contribute positively in society. 
            This project is presented by the Department of Justice and Crime Prevention, the South African Medical Research Council.<br><br>
            
            Our Principal is a member of CoLP (Community of Learning Principals), a project run by the Nelson Mandela Metro University. Here, he is given support 
            in the challenges facing heads of schools in the day-to-day running of an institution of learning.<br><br>
            
            The current economic climate combined with the large enrolment of learners from across the Mangoloaneng, places the school under great – and increasing 
            – financial pressure. However, the school maintains its aim to strive for excellence, and offers excellent opportunities in education to the community 
            which it serves. The school does, however, need increasing financial support to meet this vision.<br><br>
            
            Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School serves the local community by offering the study of Information Technology at our facility to learners from other 
            local schools such as Matatiele High, Sidinane High and St. Monicas. In recent years, this has meant that greater investment has had to be made in the 
            constant updating of our technological resources, which is also used to teach Mathematics, Geography and English, among other subjects.<br><br>
            
            Our school has always enjoyed a rich cultural diversity. In keeping with this, the school has for many years been an educational host to learners on exchange
             from overseas countries such as Germany and France. Today, the school also is an educational fort for no less than 20 learners from the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
             These learners often arrive to the shores of our school with very little knowledge of the English language, and are given the opportunity to participate in a specialised programme of English learning.<br><br>
            
            The school plays an integral role in a society that is far from the dream of a peaceful, prosperous and multicultural, democratic society. At Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School, 
            staff and learners are rich in exposure to integration when compared to other schools in the local schooling network and South Africa. This equips our learners to play an active and constructive<br><br> 
            role in our young democracy.
            
            The spans of opportunities are vast at Mahanyaneng Junior Secondary School. Learners are given the opportunity to be involved in sporting codes including Cricket, Soccer and Rugby, among others, as well as Music and Drama, debating, cultural exchanges and a host of other activities. Learners need only take the action to explore these opportunities.
            
            Under the guidance of our Headmaster, our school is encouraged to be a family that embodies the continued transformation of our developing South Africa, to contribute positively to society, and be ambassadors of positivity beyond the gates of our school, remembering to ‘forever persevere’.</p>
